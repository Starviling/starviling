Here is an implementation of a [Small Game Engine](https://github.com/Starviling/small-game-engine/tree/main/Class%20Final%20Version/GameDesign%20Project) using SFML, ZMQ, Dukglue, C++.

Kept within the repository, I have a series of PDF Documents that outline the things I have learned at various stages of the project.
