## Summary of Project
The role I took a bigger part in for this project was asset production and story direction (illustrations and music selection). I had more of a backseat role with the programming/debugging of the system - although I helped when I could.

The game was made for the the Duo Jam event hosted in 2022 with the intention for us to take a stab at writing a story. Huge props to my friend HNL2000 as he has put in a lot of work to make this game work out the way it has.

## Work on the Project
Creating the assets certainly did take a fair amount of time - getting them to look pleasing and capturing a range of expressions was difficult. Doing everything in layers in ClipStudio saved me a lot of trouble of having to redraw the character in different postures and allowed me to produce a large variety of expressions for the characters. Being able to use the 3D model in ClipStudio was certainly an interesting experience. I have to be careful not to rely on it too much - otherwise the character can lose some of the style that I wanted to mix in.

There were some bugs that HNL2000 encountered while working on the project that we initially assumed to stem from YarnSpinner, a new tool we were getting ourselves acquainted with. We were surprised to find that a good portion of our bugs were not from our misuse of YarnSpinner, but of our misunderstanding of how LeanTween treats its objects. We have to ask the LeanTween for the int ID of a particular tween - we CANNOT store a tween as an object for later reference.

The story for the game was originally supposed to be 12 days - but we cut it down to 10 days after concluding we wanted a more ambiguous ending. While we had the concept of having a cat and girl as the main characters of the story before moving into the game production, we didn't have much of an idea of how we wanted the story executed besides having the girl walking back home. In fact, we didn't have anything concrete for the story until there were about 2-3 days left remaining in the jam. With the little time we had, I laid out a few key events for each day in the story. After setting up the scene and some introductory dialogue, HNL2000 fleshed out a lot more of the finer details of character interaction and events. We would often bounce ideas back and forth of what would sound fun and toss in/out things that made the project work better.

## Interesting Thoughts
A funny thing with this project was that we used a good amount of assets that we weren't intending to use (i.e. the sketch background for the main menu screen). We kept working on some things and then one of us would point out an old incomplete work and say, "Hey, even though this is incomplete, wouldn't it still make it look better? We don't have to finish it - just toss it in!" I'd like to say that worked in favor of adding finishing touches to the game.
